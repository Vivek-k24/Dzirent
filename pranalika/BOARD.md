| --- | --- |
| Vercel: build only `main` and `Preview` (`ignoreCommand`) | Done |
| Vercel: Root Directory `apps/web`, production branch `main` | Done |
| Vercel: `dzirent.vercel.app` assigned to `Preview` | Done |
| Vercel: function region Portland | Done |
| GitHub: ruleset on `main` (PR required, no force push) | Done |
| `dzirent-server`: leaked-password protection on | Done |
| `H:\DziRent\secrets\dzirent-server.env` created | Done |
| Supabase CLI access token in `dzirent-server.env` | Done |
| Test users created in `dzirent-server` and listed in `test-user.env` | Done |

## Step 1 - Backend foundation (Codex)

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |

## Step 2 - Website foundation (Antigravity)

Planned after Step 1. Environment wiring, guest mode, home, search, listing page, sign-up gates.

## Step 3 - Shared mobile code (Codex)

| Item | Status |

| 3A Common models ported (`commonMain`) | Done |
| 3A `DzirentRepository` rewritten against contract | Done |
| 3A Phone-only interfaces (`commonMain`) + Android implementations + iOS compiling stubs | Done |

## Step 4 - Android on shared code (Claude Code)

Planned after Step 3.

## Step 5 - iOS (Claude Code)

Planned after Step 4.

## Step 6 - Switchover

All three clients build and pass owner testing on `dzirent-server`. Then the `Dzirent_Android` repo and project are retired.
